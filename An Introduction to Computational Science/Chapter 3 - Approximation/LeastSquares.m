%% Description:

% Returns the coefficients of the least-squares polynomial of degree n for
% approximating the data in x and y.

%% Input arguments:

% x - A vector containing the x-coordinates of the data.
% y - A vector containing the y-coordinates of the data. You may assume
% that x and y have the same number of elements. Your code should work if x
% and y are row vectors or if they are column vectors.
% n - The degree of the polynomial to be returned.

%% Output arguments:

% alpha - A vector with n + 1 entries specifying the coefficients of p(x),
% the least-squares approximating polynomial of degree n, in order from
% highest to lowest degree.

%% Code:

function alpha = LeastSquares(x, y, n)
